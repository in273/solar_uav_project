    fetch sunset and sunrise times

    fetch weather data for current outlined path

def scout_alternate_path_weather(power_level):
    fetch weather data for surrounding area within a day's reach
    determine weather_threat for each unit of area
    attempt to find alternate_path using simple square-to-square algorithm
    ## a square-to-square algorithm might look at all surrounding areas, pick the one with best sunlight based on forecast, then perform the same check from the next square, and so on. This is just an idea and there are almost definitely better ways of doing this--take this algorithm as a placeholder.
    if not successful, use brute force algorithm, excluding paths that have already been assessed
    ## both of these algorithms would follow a similar structure to the following from the main_loop:
    ## scout_light()
    ## get_time()
    ## calculate power_gained using sunlight, weather, and sunrise/sunset times
    ## calculate remaining_length_of_day
    ## calculate power_used during the day
    ## calculate power_left to fly during the night
    if successful:
        return alternate_path
    else:
        return NULL

            calculate remaining_length_of_day
            calculate power_used during the day
            calculate power_left to fly during the night
